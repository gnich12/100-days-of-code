# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 3, 2017 )


**Today's Progress**: Use jekyll to revamp my personal portfolio website, added a blog, and also added some icons.

**Thoughts:** After initially thought of creating a new design. i decided to keep the old one and just added the new content
and modify pieces of it. It help me out understanding how jekyll work and also how to divide the pieces of code of my website. long road ahead but it should be fun and interesting.
